# Decibel-Sound-Detector-and-Notifier
ðŸŒŸ Revolutionizing Sound Monitoring with IoT! ðŸŽ¶ðŸ“²ðŸ’¡

I am thrilled to announce our groundbreaking project that combines the power of Nodemcu, ThingHTTP of Thingspeak IoT Platform, and IFTTT Web Services to create an intelligent system for sound detection and push notifications on our mobile phones. ðŸ“±ðŸ”Š

In this innovative endeavor, we leveraged the capabilities of Nodemcu, an open-source IoT platform, to develop a cutting-edge solution for real-time sound monitoring. Using a sensitive sound sensor, we were able to accurately measure the decibel value of the environment.

By seamlessly integrating ThingHTTP, a remarkable feature of Thingspeak IoT Platform, we established a secure connection between Nodemcu and the cloud. This allowed us to transmit the decibel data in real-time, enabling us to monitor and analyze the sound levels efficiently.

But here's the most exciting part! With the seamless integration of IFTTT (If This, Then That) web services, we took sound monitoring to the next level. We programmed Nodemcu to trigger push notifications on our mobile phones whenever the decibel value exceeded 85 dB, ensuring that we stay informed and take necessary actions promptly. ðŸ“³ðŸ””

This project not only demonstrates the immense potential of IoT but also showcases how Nodemcu, ThingHTTP, and IFTTT can work in harmony to create a robust and personalized sound monitoring system. It's a testament to our commitment to harnessing technology for a safer and more connected world.
